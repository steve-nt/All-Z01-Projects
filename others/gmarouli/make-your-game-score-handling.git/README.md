# Fish Tank Hunt
Fast-paced, pointer-driven aquarium target game built with plain JavaScript modules and DOM layers.

## 🎮 Overview
- Aim the crosshair (mouse or arrow keys) and click/space to tag fish before they exit the tank.
- Chain catches to build combos, boost the score multiplier, and chase the local high-score table.
- Catch the rare red life fish for extra lives and dodge the turtle hazards that break combos and drain points.
- Levels advance on a fixed timer; spawn rates, fish variants, and difficulty scale with each stage.
- View your game history and compete globally through the paginated scoreboard that tracks all player sessions.

## 🧩 System Highlights
### Game Loop & Lifecycle (`src/core/gameLoop.js`, `src/core/lifecycle.js`)
- `createGameLoop` owns `update → render → HUD` and keeps frame work under `requestAnimationFrame`. It advances timers, transitions levels, enforces spawn caps, and prunes out-of-bounds entities before dispatching DOM positioning.
- `createLifecycleSystem` centralizes start/pause/restart flows. It resets shared state, clears DOM entities, syncs overlays, and exposes helpers like `startNewRun()` (also used by the story overlay).

### Entities & Gameplay (`src/entities/*`, `src/gameplay/*`)
- `LifeFishManager` and `TurtleManager` coordinate rare entity scheduling, motion curves, and callbacks when caught or missed.
- `spawnParrot` (main fish spawner) and `spawnBubble` (ambient layer) encapsulate DOM creation and variant selection; `entities.js` provides `positionElement`, `removeEntity`, and mass cleanup for render safety.
- `createShootingSystem` performs input hit tests, applies combo/score math, animates “caught” fish, and routes special cases (life fish heals, turtle penalties) back into shared state.

### Input & Controls (`src/core/input.js`)
- Mouse movement instantly drives the crosshair via `translate3d` for GPU compositing; `crosshairLoop` is a dedicated `requestAnimationFrame` that handles keyboard navigation independent of the main loop for minimal latency.
- Shooting is rate-limited (`SHOT_RATE_LIMIT_MS`) and normalized to game-space coordinates so future camera changes stay localized.

### HUD, Feedback, and Meta UI (`src/ui/*`, `src/story/story.js`, `index.html`)
- `createHudSystem` mirrors runtime stats in both the floating HUD and pause menu, including heart indicators and low-time styling.
- `createFeedbackSystem` handles combo banners, score popups, center notifications, and the Game Over overlay. High scores persist through `localStorage` (`src/ui/highScores.js`).
- `showScoreboard` (`src/ui/scoreboard.js`) displays a paginated global leaderboard with game history. It fetches scores from the backend API, shows rank, player name, score, and time for each session, and highlights the player's recent submission. The history feature includes pagination controls and a "Jump to my rank" button for easy navigation.
- `createMenuEffects` animates start/pause menus, celebratory bubble bursts, and shared overlays. The optional story sequence in `src/story/story.js` injects narrative beats before gameplay starts.

## 🧱 Architecture Deep Dive
- **Runtime state graph:** `main.js` owns canonical state (time, score, lives, combo, RNG seed, entity array). Smaller modules receive getter/setter lambdas instead of global imports, keeping side effects centralized and making it easy to replace the state container with Redux, Zustand, or a custom proxy later.
- **Render pipeline:** The game loop’s `render()` calls `positionElement` for every alive entity, ensuring layout work stays on `translate3d` transforms. HUD updates run after physics each frame, while keyboard-driven crosshair updates execute on a parallel RAF so input latency stays predictable even if simulation work spikes.
- **Entity lifecycle:** Every spawned DOM node is wrapped in an entity record (id, x/y, velocities, flags). `removeEntity` plus `clearEntities` guarantee DOM cleanup when levels reset or players pause, and managers such as `LifeFishManager`/`TurtleManager` hold higher-level spawn semantics so gameplay tuning lives in one place.
- **UI orchestration:** Overlay elements (start, pause, game over, story) are toggled through the lifecycle system. Menu FX rely on layered DOM nodes (`plants`, `bubbles`, `entities`, HUD) so designer tweaks do not require code changes, and the story manager can call `window.startNewRun()` without knowing anything about game internals.
- **Data surfaces:** High scores live in `localStorage`, audio settings are persisted via `settings.js`, and `responsibilities.md` plus the `docs/` folder track product decisions. These files effectively serve as lightweight “backend” artifacts the browser runtime reads/writes without external services.

Key module responsibilities:
- `src/core/constants.js` – Shared tuning knobs (duration, spawn cadence, level caps).
- `src/core/settings.js` – Sound/volume persistence helpers.
- `src/core/lifecycle.js` – Start/pause/resume orchestration and resets.
- `src/gameplay/spawning.js` – Fish/bubble creation and world placement.
- `src/gameplay/shooting.js` – Shot handling, combos, penalties, and capture animations.
- `src/ui/hud.js` – Scoreboard rendering for HUD and pause stats.
- `src/ui/feedback.js` – Combo messaging, popups, and Game Over flow.
- `src/ui/scoreboard.js` – Global scoreboard and game history viewer with pagination and rank highlighting.
- `src/ui/highScores.js` – Local high score persistence and top-five leaderboard management.
- `src/api/client.js` – Backend API client for posting scores and fetching paginated game history.

## 🚀 Setup & Run
The project is 100% static assets plus ES modules, so any HTTP server works. For full functionality including the global scoreboard, you'll need to run both the backend API and frontend server:

**Step 0: Initial Setup (First Time Only)**
After cloning the repository, you need to install dependencies and build the CSS:

```bash
npm install
npm run build:css
```

Or use the convenience script:
```bash
npm run setup
```

This is required because `node_modules` and the compiled CSS (`dist/styles.css`) are not committed to the repository (as per `.gitignore`). You only need to run this once after cloning, or whenever dependencies change.

**Step 1: Start the Score API (Backend)**
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
```bash
cd api/server
go run .
```
```

The API will start on `http://localhost:8090`. Keep this terminal open.

**Step 2: Start the Frontend Server**
Open a second terminal and run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/` in a modern browser. The start overlay appears first; press **Start Game** (or progress through the story overlay) to allow `main.js` to bootstrap the loop. 

**Note:** The game will work without the backend API, but the global scoreboard and history features require the API to be running. No build step or bundler is required—just keep both servers running so module imports resolve correctly.

## ⚡ Performance Notes
- **Layered compositing:** Separate DOM layers for plants, bubbles, entities, and HUD keep repaint regions tight. Entities are positioned via `translate3d(...)` to stay on the GPU compositor.
- **Dual RAF loops:** The main loop handles simulation/render while the crosshair/input loop runs independently, preventing long update steps from introducing cursor lag.
- **Adaptive spawning:** Spawn timers and max fish counts scale with level, preventing DOM overload while still raising difficulty.
- **FPS instrumentation:** Instantaneous FPS is sampled each frame (`hud-fps`) so feature work can watch for regressions. Rate limiting on shots and capped bubble counts protect against DOM spam.

## 🛠️ Extending the Codebase
For deeper changes, start by tracing control flow in `main.js`: it is the central handshake that wires modules together, so augmenting the state map or providing new UI hooks there keeps the rest of the code decoupled.

## 🗄️ Data & Backend Considerations
- **Local-first persistence:** High scores and audio preferences are written to `localStorage`. The code isolates persistence inside `highScores.js` and `settings.js`, so migrating to IndexedDB or a remote API requires stubbing those modules rather than rewriting gameplay.
- **Global scoreboard & history:** The game includes a backend-integrated global scoreboard (`src/ui/scoreboard.js`) that displays paginated game history. Scores are posted to the Go backend API (`api/server/main.go`) which persists them to `scores.json`. The history viewer shows rank, player name, score, and time for each session, with pagination controls and automatic highlighting of the player's recent submission. The frontend gracefully falls back to local storage if the API is unavailable.
- **Backend integration points:** To mirror scores or telemetry on a server, replace `addHighScore`/`updateHighScoreListUI` with fetch calls. Lifecycle hooks (`showGameOver`, `restartGame`, `startNewRun`) provide clean points to emit analytics events or WebSocket messages.
- **Session state serialization:** Because all mutable state is exposed via getters/setters in `main.js`, exporting a snapshot (for saving replays or supporting backend-driven resumes) is a matter of cloning that state bag and the `entities` array—no hidden globals exist.
- **Future services:** The existing Go backend (`api/server/main.go`) handles score persistence and pagination. Future enhancements could include real-time leaderboard updates, player profiles, or cross-platform synchronization. Nothing in the frontend assumes network availability, so backend rollout can happen incrementally without breaking offline play.

## 🔧 Development Workflow
- **Tooling:** No build chain is required. Running `python3 -m http.server 8080` (or `npm serve`) is sufficient, which keeps debugging straightforward through browser devtools. Source maps are irrelevant because every module is already human-readable.
- **Docs & planning:** `docs/` record design discussions, art direction, and work agreements. Treat them as a living product spec; contributors should update these files when introducing mechanics or visual language changes.
- **Testing & profiling:** Use the HUD FPS readout plus Chrome DevTools’ performance tab to evaluate new effects. The dual-loop architecture makes it easy to isolate regressions: if crosshair lag appears, inspect `input.js`; if entity stutter occurs, profile `gameLoop.update`.
- **Story-driven flows:** The `story` module demonstrates how to build modal interactions that gate game start. Future tutorials, quests, or backend-driven missions can reuse that pattern.
